## VitalsCare: Remote Patient Monitoring System

### Inspiration
A willingness to work with hardware to measure factors and to be able to incorporate them into a Web Application as the user interface.

### What it does
A patient health monitoring system that checks the patient's certain vitals to detect whether or not the patient has health problems.

### How we built it
We built the Web Application using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is the for the user interface for them to be able to interact with the website. We also used Arduino to connect the sensors to be able to read the readings. 

### Challenges we ran into
Connecting the sensor readings from Arduino into the framework Flask on Python.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The general UI of the project and the authentication system and being able to detect accurate readings on the sensors.

### What we learned
Connecting hardware with software is a lot more challenging than we thought. Generating the individual sensor readings turned out to be easier than we expected, but actually connecting the data from those sensors to a web application is a hard process that we are still figuring out.

### What's next for VitalsCare: Remote Patient Monitoring System
Adding a body temperature sensor to incorporate more vital checking to have more usability for the user.
